**RATs** is a multi-agent Code-as-Policy system for lifelong robot skill learning. During free-form *play* a team of LLM agents invents its own tasks, writes code-as-policy, and distills successful executions into a reusable skill library; at *evaluation* those skills are reused as planner context — no gradients, no RL, all learning through structured natural-language feedback and code reuse. RATs runs in two stages:

| Stage | What it does |
| ----- | ------------ |
| **Play** | Curiosity-driven skill acquisition: a proposer → planner → policy-writer → verifier → failure-diagnoser loop invents tasks, executes code-as-policy, and grows a skill library from what works. |
| **Evaluation** | Frozen learned skills are injected as planner context and compared head-to-head with CaP-X baselines, in two complementary settings: **in-domain** (LIBERO-PRO, MolmoSpaces) and **cross-environment transfer** (reusing the same skills in Robosuite and on a real Franka Panda). |

## Installation

RATs uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and runs on **Python 3.10** with a **CUDA-capable GPU**. The full guide — cache/quota tuning, every submodule, the MolmoSpaces bridge, and the `capx-baseline/` environments — is in **[docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md)**.

```bash
# Clone
git clone --branch main --depth 1 https://github.com/Playful-RATs/RATs rats
cd rats

# Root runtime submodules (LIBERO-PRO + MolmoSpaces)
git submodule update --init --depth 1 \
  rats/third_party/LIBERO-PRO \
  rats/third_party/libero_dependencies/robosuite \
  rats/third_party/robosuite \
  rats/third_party/contact_graspnet_pytorch \
  rats/third_party/curobo \
  rats/third_party/sam3

# Root env
uv venv .venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --frozen --active --extra libero --extra contactgraspnet

# LIBERO prompts for ~/.libero/config.yaml on first import in a fresh shell.
# Pre-create it to keep setup and batch runs non-interactive.
mkdir -p ~/.libero
cat > ~/.libero/config.yaml <<EOF
benchmark_root: $PWD/rats/third_party/LIBERO-PRO/libero/libero
bddl_files: $PWD/rats/third_party/LIBERO-PRO/libero/libero/./bddl_files
init_states: $PWD/rats/third_party/LIBERO-PRO/libero/libero/./init_files

```

> The root `.venv` runs both LIBERO-PRO and MolmoSpaces. MolmoSpaces additionally needs a `conda` bridge env and ~tens of GB of assets; CaP-X baselines, Robosuite transfer, and real-world transfer run from `capx-baseline/` with their own envs. See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for all of it.

## Quick Start

This section assumes the root `.venv` from Installation is active. Set a model provider and the runtime exports first:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."       # and/or GEMINI_API_KEY / OPENROUTER_API_KEY
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD:${PYTHONPATH:-}"
export CAPX_ENV_STACK=libero
export MUJOCO_GL=egl
export PYOPENGL_PLATFORM=egl
```

### 1. Play — acquire skills

```bash
python scripts/run_rats.py \
  --config env_configs/libero/rats_libero_play.yaml \
  --explore --iterations 50 \
  --output-dir outputs/play_libero
```

MolmoSpaces play with the launcher-managed bridge is in [docs/play.md](docs/play.md).

### 2. Evaluate — in-domain (RATs vs. CaP-X)

The batch driver runs all six LIBERO-PRO suites (× 10 tasks × 5 trials) with skill reuse frozen:

```bash
RATS_VERIFIER_STRICT_BENCHMARK=1 python scripts/run_rats_libero_pro_batch.py \
  --seed-skill-library outputs/play_libero/snapshots/iter050/skills.json \
  --extra-rats-flags "--model google/gemini-3.5-flash" \
  --output-dir outputs/rats_libero_pro_iter050seed \
  --gpus 0,1,2,3,4,6,7 --workers 18 --skip-completed
```

CaP-X baselines, the MolmoSpaces eval, and result summarization are in [docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md).

### 3. Evaluate — cross-environment transfer

Reuse LIBERO-learned skills as planner context in Robosuite and on a real Franka — see [docs/cross-environment.md](docs/cross-environment.md).

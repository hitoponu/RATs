"""Policy Quality Checker: two-tier gatekeeper.

Tier 1 (hard gate): syntax errors, invalid API calls, infinite loops.
  - Blocks execution, returns to Policy Writer.
  - Does NOT count as an execution attempt.

Tier 2 (advisory): trial-and-error patterns, style issues.
  - Flags concerns but code proceeds to Executor.

Server availability is probed at init time so that primitives whose
backing servers are offline are automatically blocked.

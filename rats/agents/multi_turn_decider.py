"""Multi-turn decider: CaP-X-style "FINISH vs REGENERATE+code" gate.

Runs inside an attempt's turn loop (env not reset between turns). After a
turn's code executes, the decider sees the executed code, console output,
and the resulting frame, then returns either:

  - FINISH      -> stop iterating and hand off to the verifier
  - REGENERATE  -> a new code block to execute on the next turn

This is a single LLM call per turn, much lighter than the full
verifier -> diagnoser -> feedback chain. It only gates within-attempt
turn transitions; attempt boundaries still use the full RATS pipeline so
skill extraction and failure-memory accounting are unaffected.

Mirrors rats/envs/trial.py:_handle_multi_turn_step (the CaP-X reference
implementation), simplified for RATS:
  - Always uses the after-execution frame; no visual differencing or
    video VDM (config-selectable later if needed).
  - Returns a plain dict instead of CaP-X's tuple of five values.

Console stderr:

{stderr}
```

If there were no errors during compilation or execution the stderr block \
will be empty. The attached image shows the current state of the \
environment AFTER the code above was executed.

Decide based on the image (visual evidence) and the console output:
  - FINISH if the task goal already appears satisfied.
  - REGENERATE followed by new ```python``` code if more actions are \
needed. The environment WILL NOT be reset before your new code runs, so \
do not redo actions whose effects you can already see in the image \
(e.g. don't re-grasp an object that is already in the gripper).

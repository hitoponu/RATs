"""Task Proposer: selects next task via curiosity-driven in-context reasoning.

Reads the skill library, scene context, and task history to propose tasks
that would discover new, useful skills.

Supports two modes:
- **catalog**: select from predefined tasks (BEHAVIOR / LIBERO catalog).
- **novel**: propose a novel task spec (language + objects + goal) that the
  Environment Creator will turn into a BDDL file.  Used for LIBERO.

"""Failure Memory: persistent memory of past failures for RATS.

Two-layer memory:
  Layer 1 -- Failure Episode Store (raw, factual)
    Records every terminal failure with structured metadata.
  Layer 2 -- Distilled Lessons (compressed, actionable)
    Periodically LLM-compressed rules from raw episodes.

Retrieval is keyword/tag-based (no embeddings). All methods degrade
gracefully when the store is empty (first run).

# at 205,184 (the diagnoser talking to itself: "Maybe the robot went to the
# cabinet... But the logs show... Maybe the frames are from..."). That single
# episode was ~52k tokens, and since _distill_one_group feeds `episodes[:5]`
# to the LLM it pushed the distill prompt past the 131k context window: from
# iteration 29 on, EVERY iteration died with `400 ... maximum context length`

# 8000 is ~7x the largest legitimate diagnosis, so this only ever fires on

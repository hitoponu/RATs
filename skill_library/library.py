"""JSON-based skill library for RATS.

Stores reusable skills as parameterized functions. Provides context to
Task Proposer (lightweight summaries) and Planner (full code + docs).
Only the Planner retrieves from the library for task execution.

Reliability tracking
--------------------
Each learned skill carries usage_count/success_count, a Wilson-lower-bound
score, and a tier ∈ {verified, experimental, deprecated}. Tier is derived
from empirical usage, not declared at creation; record_usage(name, success)
drives the transitions. The Planner receives skills pre-sorted by
(tier, Wilson score) so reliable skills bubble up without any prompt-level
"must-use" rule.
